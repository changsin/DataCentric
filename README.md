# Data-Centric AI Competition
[Data-Centric AI Competition](https://https-deeplearning-ai.github.io/data-centric-comp/) is initiated by Andrew Ng and organized by DeepLearning AI.
Unlike Kaggle competitions where the goal is to improve the model, the data-centric competition "freezes" the model and focuses on the data quality.

The strategies that I am trying are:

1. EDA: understand the data and spot the quality issues - DONE
2. Cleanup: DONE
3. Augment and rebalance train/val/test datasets

The winners are announced and their methodologies are shared in blogs:
